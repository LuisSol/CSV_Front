# Front CSV part

## about my approach on the task

I opted for a create app template with typescript because even if im kind of new to typescript (5 months) i find it very useful to avaid most of the javascript pit falls.

I used styled components for styling cuz im very comfortable with it.

Also i plan to use react-query to mannage server state

I dont see the need of global state mannagement so i will not use Context, neither Redux, i will stick with local state mannagement.
